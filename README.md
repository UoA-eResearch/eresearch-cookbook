eResearch cookbook - 2 minute recipes for scientists
==================

A template for capturing task recipes for repeatable scientific practices in a consistent format and hosted in a centralised online repository.

    e.g. envisioning simple 1-page instructional guides for common day-to-day research tasks (think modularised mini-man pages).

 The recipes are intended to be concrete, instance based examples, specific to certain tasks, software or technologies. They are short operations manuals that assume little background on behalf of the user. They don't attempt to explain all the principles or deep knowledge. Just get the job done quickly, correctly, using best practice and starting with examples.  We can link these to more detailed educational resources such as software carpentry. (when you are too busy or just starting out, a good example that exactly fits your need/task is invaluable!)
