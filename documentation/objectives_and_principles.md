So you're an eResearch master chef and you want to publish a recipe to help 
others. Here are some guidelines and principles to follow, to ensure a 
consistent style and a pleasing, cognitively optimal format.

Organisation
------------
- Recipes should be task-based, and organised hierarchially via the main task
they describe. Users locate and search for recipes based on the task at hand
and according to what they want to do.

Style
-----
- Use text to describe actions, and pictures, diagrams or screenshots to 
descibe locations.

- Use precise headings that correspond to fixed goals.  


Format
------
- Ideally, recipes should fit on one or two A4 pages, should reserachers prefer
to have hard copies for reference. All the steps and information should fit on
a one or two page open spread.
