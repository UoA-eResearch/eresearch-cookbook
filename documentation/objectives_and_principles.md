Objectives and prinicples for the Cookbook
==========================================

We adopt the principles and guidelines used for the information organization in bibliographic systems (library catalogs, indexing, etc.) [1] to articulate and inform the making of eResearch-cookbook idea. The overarching objective of eResearch-cookbook is to create an open, online (web 2.0 style) repository for researchers to assist them in their day-to-day repeatable technical tasks by providing them modular and cognitively pleasing recipes. These recipes are very short, concrete and task-oriented to get the job done quickly and correctly. We also want the cookbook to have two-way communication, so researchers can not only be the comsumers of this knowledge, but may also contribute to the knowledge-base. 

In terms of designing the cookbook and recipes, we formulated the key (both top-level and sub-tasks) objectives and principles that the system should adhere to. The objectives state what this system is suppose to accomplish and the principles determine the nature of the means to meet this objectives. To make the distinction between objectives and principles clear, we use this approach of conceptual and operational entities. The principles are conceptual entities, that characterizes what is to be defined in terms of system's properties. On the other hand, objectives are operational, i.e. they specify the functionalities or steps tp be followed to idetify what is being defined. For example, a cake can be characterized by the principles of sweetness, sponginess etc., but it is defined operationally by its recipe.

Below, we discuss the key principles that the design of eResearch-cookbook follows:
<ol>
<li><b>Openness:</b> The principle of openness draws from the notion of 'Open Science' to keep our scientific knowledge free to use, re-use and distribute without legal, technological or social constraints. All content, code and material well documented and shared with the community under open licences (CC-BY) for reuse.</li>
<li><b>Modularity:</b> Modularity refers to keep unrelated parts of a systems separated and related parts grouped together. This supports changing a component or adding new components without adversely affecting other components. Putting related parts together makes it easier to see the relationships between them when debugging them or adding functionality to them. eResearch-cookbook adheres to this principle to make our system design modular to be easily extendable and to be easy to debug. </li>
<li><b>Evolvavbility:</b> The notion of evolvablity refers to the iterative process of designing a system and how our requirements keep changing all the time. Especially, the idea of eResearch-cookbook requires a bottom-up approach to design the system through the recipes. This would require the system to be designed in a fashion to allow it to changes and update.</li> 
<li><b>Cognitively pleasing:</b></li>
<li><b>Task and performance-oriented:</b></li>

</ol>

The below table discusses the main objectives and corresponding sub-tasks and the principles they build on. to keep those objectives operational, we have used <b>verbs</b>, representing the functionality that system needs to acheive.

---------
So you're an eResearch master chef and you want to publish a recipe to help 
others. Here are some guidelines and principles to follow, to ensure a 
consistent style and a pleasing, cognitively optimal format.

Organisation
------------
- Recipes should be task-based, and organised hierarchially via the main task
they describe. Users locate and search for recipes based on the task at hand
and according to what they want to do.

Style
-----
- Use text to describe actions, and pictures, diagrams or screenshots to 
descibe locations.

- Use precise headings that correspond to fixed goals.  


Format
------
- Ideally, recipes should fit on one or two A4 pages, should reserachers prefer
to have hard copies for reference. All the steps and information should fit on
a one or two page open spread.
