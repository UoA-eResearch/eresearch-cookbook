Elements of a 2min recipe
=========================

A list to get started of all the primitives a recipe page might need.
This is just a start - please add/edit.

For now just focused on visual and instructional organisation.
Metadata is important but can be extended/built later...

Also not worred yet about the best html or other elements/structures to map 
them to.... 

We are asking what are the elements of page design, and what makes a 
good design for instructions....
####Note - users usually decide whether or not to read a manual in about 3 seconds. 
Design and layout is important.

Basic design principles - many taken from the literature...

Good things include
- less text
- lots of whitespace (our eyes need breaks)
- left justification
- pictures/illustrations


We need to map the following document elements to a visual style and code
container.

###Element 

Title/recipe name - Short, and task orientated

Introduction - heading and text block to orientate the user, provide an intial mental model. may inclide images.

Headings - Informative subgoals
	2 levels - Goal, subgoal

Step - 2 levels numbered and lettered (sub step), short text block

Note - supplimentary information (non critical) that immediately follows a step or substep. heading with text and/or image.

Caution - Warning info that may preceed or immediately follow a step or substep. Heading with text and/or image.

Figure - image that shows graphical instruction or locations 

Figure caption - text, numbered... title and description for figure.

Code fragment - used to dispaly what a user should type, or see on screen (script or at the terminal)

Echo - the text a user should type (almost exactly) into the terminal/window

Echo variable - the text a user needs to type, but substitite with their own local information (username etc..)

Table - self explanatory. html can do this.

Table caption - self explanatory.

Parallel section - container that splits screen/page vertically and contains steps/figures etc for 2 alternate instruction paths - eg PC/Mac...

Footer - to hold license, author, and version information. 
- License . CC snippet to contain licence text, image, link.
- Author . Name, link, @handle
- Version . date, v, (datetime, text field)
